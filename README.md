# JavaScript-The-hard-part-1
Here I will present my JavaScript Beginner to Expert mission. In future commits I will explain most of terms or keywords that are used on most of comments so feel free to ask comment anything that is not understandable. Most of the code written in these files will be from tutorials and books that I came across and I'll try to explain them in depth as much as I understand. A brief explanation I am a entry level Developer, I think the best way to learn is by trying to teach someone else since "you know it you can explain it". And this is my first tackle on this feel free to correct me if you see anything odd!
